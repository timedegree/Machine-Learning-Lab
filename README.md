# Machine Learning Lab

My Machine Learning course assignments feel pretty basic XD

## Content
- **Lab 1**: Learn basic operations with NumPy.
- **Lab 2**: Learn basic operations with Matplotlib.
- **Lab 3**: Perform linear regression to fit a curve for given `x` and `y` scatter points.
- **Lab 4**: Use the data from Lab 3 to fit the curve using the gradient descent method.
- **Lab 4-Extra**: Plot the loss trajectory for the gradient descent method in Lab 4.
- **Lab 5**: Implement a logistic regression model using gradient descent on a given dataset and visualize the training samples along with the decision boundary in 2D.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd lab_directory  # Replace 'lab_directory' with the specific lab folder name
python main.py
```
